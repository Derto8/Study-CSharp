## About

A project with my ideas for learning C# WPF. Implemented in the project:
-  System transition between windows of a WPF application.
-  User registration system.
-  Administrator console, with which you can change the data in the data table, delete and add rows in the data table.
-  Convert the picture to ASCII table characters.
-  A beautiful and handy calculator with basic arithmetic operations.

## How to use?

### Before starting the project:
- You need to import the database, it can be downloaded from the repository, the database is located in the DataBase folder. After downloading, you need to create an empty `LearningCSharp` database, and import the downloaded file into it.
- Next, you need to go to the specified path `LearningCShap\LearningCShap\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1`, and open the file `LearningCShap.exe`, the project is ready to go!

### How to login to Admin Console?
- Enter the username and password of the user whose status is "Administrator". All data can be found in the `users` table in the `LearningCSharp` database.

### How to change data in `users` table via DataGrid?
- Click once on the `id` of the user (row) whose data you want to change, then double-click on the field of the same row where you want to change the data - we change the data in the DataGrid table, at the same time the changed data in the DataGrid is changed in the database `LearningCSharp` data.
